1. on the report page, in the area section, I'd like it to show the ground floor and upper, basement, and total square footage.

2. if being used on phone or tablet, when clicking generate report, is there a way to make the page open to download it as a pdf and prefill the save name with the policy number first then 'Load Test' and the date of the inspection
