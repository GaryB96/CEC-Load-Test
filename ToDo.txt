1. on the report page, in the area section, I'd like it to show the ground floor and upper, basement, and total square footage.

2. if being used on phone or tablet, when clicking generate report, is there a way to make the page open to download it as a pdf and prefill the save name with the policy number first then 'Load Test' and the date of the inspection

3. need a little watts calculator, two dropdowns, one for watts and amps, the other for 120 or 240 volts.

4. add a space between the white border and the start of the section headers.
